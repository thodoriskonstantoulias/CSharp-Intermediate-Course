    //The Push() method stores the given object on top of the stack. We use the “object” type here so
    //we can store any objects inside the stack.Remember the “object” class is the base of all classes
    //in the.NET Framework.So any types can be automatically upcast to the object. Make sure to
    //take into account the scenario that null is passed to this object. We should not store null
    //references in the stack. So if null is passed to this method, you should throw an
    //InvalidOperationException.
    //The Pop() method removes the object on top of the stack and returns it.Make sure to take into
    //account the scenario that we call the Pop() method on an empty stack. In this case, this method
    //should throw an InvalidOperationException
    //The Clear() method removes all objects from the stack.
