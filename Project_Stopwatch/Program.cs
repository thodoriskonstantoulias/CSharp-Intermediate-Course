        //Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop. Duration should be a
        //value in TimeSpan.Display the duration on the console.
        //We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times.So we may start and stop it and then
        //start and stop it again. Make sure the duration value each time is calculated properly.
        //We should not be able to start a stopwatch twice in a row (because that may overwrite the initial
        //start time). So the class should throw an InvalidOperationException if its started twice.
